### [JSL11] Agile Board - Kanban Task Management App
This online application for task management using JavaScript is intended to assist users in tracking their progress and organizing their work across several boards. Users of the program may create, modify, and remove tasks in addition to switching between boards and bright and dark themes.

### Features
Board Management: To organize their duties, users can make several boards. Every board stands for a certain project or category.
Task management: Users have the ability to add, modify, and remove tasks. Within each board, tasks are arranged according to their current state (TODO, DOING, DONE).
The ability to switch between bright and dark themes lets users customize their experience and lessen eye strain.
Sidebar Toggle: To improve visibility and concentrate on work management, users can choose to reveal or conceal the sidebar navigation.
Data Persistence: By utilizing the browser's localStorage feature, tasks and board data are kept locally, so users may access them even after closing or refreshing the page.

### Overal learning

This was a difficult challenge for me,I learned how important it is to know the basics of JavaScript and how elements play a huge role when creating an application. This also showed me how good my debugging skills are better than my coding skills and how I have to work 2 time harder on my coding skills.

Stressful as the project was, I'm happy with the lesson experience, it kinda of gave me a real work place exprience and the kind of pressure that one will endure in the projects.
